cybersecurity advisory released in response to active exploitation ofCurrently, there is a proliferation of research focused on the application of pre-trained models in the field of cybersecurity. However, their attention is often primarily directed towards the direct application of large-scale models, such as BERT, while research on handling lengthy cybersecurity texts (exceeding 512 tokens) remains relatively scarce. Alvares et al. conducted a comparative analysis of BERT and Word2Vec for malware classification tasks.[9]
Zhu C et al proposes a deep learning-based framework based on BERT for fine-grained vulnerability type identification, achieving significant performance in detecting vulnerabilities and providing valuable insights for software security. [10]
To address the limitation of the maximum input length of 512 tokens in BERT models, this study employs BRIO for data preprocessing tasks. BRIO, the latest advancement in text summarization in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), has achieved state-of-the-art performance in extractive summarization. Liu Y et al introduces a novel training paradigm for abstractive summarization models, addressing the limitations of maximum likelihood estimation and improving performance during inference. By assuming a non-deterministic distribution and assigning probability mass based on the quality of candidate summaries, the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on the CNN/DailyMail and XSum datasets. The model also exhibits improved estimation of probabilities, positively correlated with the quality of candidate summaries.[11]
In the pursuit of achieving optimal model performance without compromising computational efficiency, several state-of-the-art language models have been introduced, namely, DistilBERT[12], TinyBERT[13], MobileBERT[14], and ALBERT[15]. These models are derived from the original BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model, designed to understand the context of words in a sentence more accurately. They strive to retain the strength of BERT while improving its efficiency.
